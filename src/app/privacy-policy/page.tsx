                                browsers and some mobile operating systems and
                                mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (
                                &quot;DNT &quot;) feature or setting you can
                                activate to signal your privacy preference not
                                to have data about your online browsing
                                activities monitored and collected. At this
                                stage, no uniform technology standard for

                                mechanism that automatically communicates your
                                choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
                                for online tracking is adopted that we must
                                follow in the future, we will inform you about
                                that practice in a revised version of this
